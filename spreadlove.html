            <h1>What is SpreadLOVE Hackathon?</h1>
            <p>SpreadLove is a hackathon hosted by Spark2Code focused on a topic we will release on intro-day. We are based in San-Diego, but our hackathon is open to anyone willing to participate. We strive to educate beginners as well as challenge advanced participants, so we strongly encourage you to join regardless of your level of expertise. Our competition will be held virtually through discord from November 19-21, and you can participate in groups upto 4 or as an individual. You will build a project over the weekend and will be judged by professionals in the field of STEM. Again, no experience is necessary, and we hope you participate!
            </p>
            <h1>FAQ's</h1>
            <ol>
                <li><h2>What is a hackathon?</h2><br> A hackathon is usually associated with coding and creating software to solve a challenge. In the case of SpreadLove, only the latter is true. We will accept projects of any type (albeit with some requirements), and coding is not necessary to submit! Some examples of project submissions include Computer-Aided-Design models, Websites, Applications, Algorithms, etc. For more submission requirements, check insert link. 
                </li>
                <li><h2>What will the topic be?</h2><br> We will release the topic on intro day!</li>
                <li><h2>Where is the hackathon hosted?</h2><br> The hackathon will be hosted online mainly on twitch and our discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/GC2zetM457">https://discord.gg/GC2zetM457</a>.
                </li>
                <li><h2>Who can participate?</h2><br> Anyone. When we say anyone, we mean it. We encourage anyone interested in learning new skills to join our server and participate. If you are a veteran hackathon participant or have sharp technical skills, don't worry. We have a surprise for you.</li>
                <li><h2>Do I need a team to participate?</h2><br> You do not need a team to participate. If you would like to submit a project alone, that is completely fine. If you decide to have a team, we do have a requirement: The maximum number of people we will allow on one team is 4 participants. 
                </li>
                <li><h2>What do I do if I don't have a team?</h2> <br> If you don't have a team and would like to join one, don't stress! We will be creating teams for people without one, so everyone has a chance to participate and meet new people. 
                </li>
                <li><h2>How do I join?</h2><br> Join our hackathon by completing this form (insert link) and join our discord server (insert link), where we will post updates, announcements, winners, and more. Joining the discord server is equally as important as completing the form. You will not be able to submit a project without being on the server so remember to join!
